0:00:00 - 0:00:09:  is to have 50 for like the silent auction and then some stuff for a raffle um and then we've
0:00:09 - 0:00:16:  got tickets being sold um that will start most of those sales this weekend bethany has um an
0:00:16 - 0:00:23:  account set up so that you know people can buy tickets online so we're hoping for a good event
0:00:23 - 0:00:27:  And then we've got Matthew at churches getting the music people together.
0:00:29 - 0:00:29:  Great.
0:00:31 - 0:00:32:  That's terrific.
0:00:32 - 0:00:43:  And, you know, anything in terms of any, aside from just what I said, any other sort of, you know, visuals, tech, whatever, as you know, we've got a lot of support on the tech side and design and all that.
0:00:43 - 0:00:45:  So if there's anything you were like, well, hey, we'd like to do that.
0:00:45 - 0:00:51:  Even if it's like, quote, for the event, not like, quote, for us, we're happy to, you know, assist.
0:00:52 - 0:00:51: 
0:00:59 - 0:01:05:  yeah we have one of the volunteers is going to like take on uh you know the public relations sort of piece of it and doing stuff on social media but i think it would be great if um we
0:01:05 - 0:01:11:  send you over like whatever copy she comes up with and then you guys can do with it whatever you want
0:01:11 - 0:01:18:  okay you want to add it into your social media rotation or something like that that would be
0:01:18 - 0:01:24:  great sure yeah that'd be great we we do a lot of social so of course we're more than happy to
0:01:24 - 0:01:30:  to do that and you know do post social if you want like you know tag the church or or just the name
0:01:30 - 0:01:38:  of the church etc yeah cool no i think that would be great okay great and then um so for now if you
0:01:38 - 0:01:42:  i know i sent you a lot of stuff i'm happy to quickly pop through because that was saying we
0:01:42 - 0:01:48:  were talking anyway you know in what we met previously so I'm happy to do that or anything
0:01:48 - 0:01:54:  else for now that just kind of situates stuff for you on any of this I also can discuss about Judy
0:01:54 - 0:02:00:  I know you mentioned that as well yeah I don't the only thing that I can think of is there was
0:02:00 - 0:02:12:  a moment in time when you guys were trying to uh what's the word I want um recruit some
0:02:12 - 0:02:18:  some volunteers to go out and do things and I think that there was a thought that maybe they
0:02:18 - 0:02:24:  might be paid and so I don't know if that's where Judy got that from but she literally said
0:02:24 - 0:02:28:  she thought that we were raising money to pay the staff and I had to like
0:02:28 - 0:02:37:  I was like absolutely not so is there something specific we can say this money will go for this
0:02:37 - 0:02:41:  type of effort? Is there something that I can kind of earmark there?
0:02:42 - 0:02:46:  Yeah. So I'll say to you kind of in your board member capacity, right? I mean, like,
0:02:47 - 0:02:50:  you know, I think one way that we've done this, and even like with these recent contract
0:02:50 - 0:02:53:  opportunities that have been arising, and there's this now this guy in New York with this big group,
0:02:53 - 0:03:00:  like basically we make clear, you know, like certainly stuff can go for items, you know,
0:03:00 - 0:03:05:  items, gas expenses, et cetera, if we're out doing street care. Now, with that said, we always say
0:03:05 - 0:03:14:  We do our best to, you know, contact and get gift cards and other connections with local entities and stores to, you know, cut that cost.
0:03:15 - 0:03:20:  But the cost that cannot be cut, which is a really important cost, is trainings.
0:03:20 - 0:03:22:  And she might have heard that and thought what she said.
0:03:23 - 0:03:29:  But to me, that's like their bread and butter here is when a lot of people go out and like hand out a sandwich and then kind of run to the next street.
0:03:29 - 0:03:34:  Our goal or want to make a sandwich and go out, our goal and training is the best way to do that, remote as well as in person.
0:03:35 - 0:03:43:  And in some cases, taking people out and sort of training along with kind of a leader with you, that's where we see value.
0:03:43 - 0:03:53:  And then in your sort of capacity as a board member, obviously, that helps us build capacity in terms of just being able to scale stuff and just do more because it is money coming to Bright Mind.
0:03:53 - 0:03:58:  I'm fine with someone's like, hey, I just want to feel like it's buying a bunch of peanut butter and bread.
0:03:58 - 0:03:59:  Yeah, it's fine.
0:03:59 - 0:03:59: 
0:04:07 - 0:04:07:  Or, you know, the other thing we often do, and people like this and some of the groups have requested this, is to have like a T-shirt that says Bright Mind or that says Bright Mind and Bethany.
0:04:10 - 0:04:11:  We can have, you know, both logos and get it from the source we order from.
0:04:15 - 0:04:16:  So that is a way that because we're very good at buying cheap stuff, they'll get a really good deal.
0:04:19 - 0:04:19:  We might also get a tiny bit of profit on that.
0:04:20 - 0:04:33:  In some cases, we don't get any profit. But so sort of telling you that as a board member as well as in your Bethany capacity, you know, I think if you – I think trainings is something people often appreciate because they understand we're adding long-term value to Bethany social action, you know, volunteers, et cetera.
0:04:34 - 0:04:38:  If that sounds like the wrong direction for what they want to hear, we can talk about other stuff.
0:04:39 - 0:04:44:  There's other things that we have funded with that, you know, you can fund like event flyers and this and that.
0:04:44 - 0:04:47:  But all those are sort of extras that frankly don't build capacity.
0:04:47 - 0:04:51:  So that's part of why we push toward trainings, because it empowers people.
0:04:54 - 0:05:09:  So you're training folks like myself to go out into the community to be able to support homeless in a better way.
0:05:10 - 0:05:15:  Yeah, and so there's a few levels of this, and I've dealt with this in a lot of types of running volunteer work programs.
0:05:15 - 0:05:22:  A lot of people are like, hey, this is great, but, like, well, I can't go out, so, like, I'll make sandwiches or I'll give some money or I'll go to the store for you.
0:05:22 - 0:05:28:  So we're trying to move people from, like, fear to understanding that they can have more of a direct role.
0:05:28 - 0:05:36:  Then we're trying to move them from, like, okay, I can walk in and kind of give this sandwich and maybe smile if we're lucky and then keep walking because I'm scared or probably not even smile.
0:05:37 - 0:05:44:  So we're like, you know, you can give this sandwich and here's the health item and here's how you can get to be able to smile even if the person is a little bit – you're uncomfortable around.
0:05:44 - 0:05:46:  And that's a skill that people have to learn.
0:05:46 - 0:05:55:  And then the next step is, like, here's how you can get from, like, giving a smile on the sandwich to, like, you know, making the sandwich while you're with them and being there for 30 seconds and actually doing a bit of informal intake.
0:05:56 - 0:06:02:  And that adds a lot to the homeless person's experience and the volunteer's experience over time and their ability to talk to other people.
0:06:02 - 0:06:09:  And then the next level is, in essence, like, here's how you can, you know, like, utilize our services, like, go into the app.
0:06:09 - 0:06:10:  You know, you talk to a person.
0:06:10 - 0:06:11:  You find out what their issue is.
0:06:11 - 0:06:13:  Because usually a person, you can find their issue.
0:06:13 - 0:06:14:  You're not going to find it in one sandwich.
0:06:15 - 0:06:22:  But in a conversation, we've gotten people off the street based on understanding what their situation is and, like, getting them to the service they need.
0:06:22 - 0:06:24:  But that doesn't happen just by giving a sandwich and running.
0:06:24 - 0:06:35:  So we're trying to, like, turn people into good advocates for that, what you said, the actual handoff, as well as good advocates for talking to someone later who's like, whoa, what are you doing with homeless people?
0:06:35 - 0:06:37:  What are you, like, why do you do that?
0:06:37 - 0:06:41:  And then you can become able to articulate why it's important, why it's safe, et cetera.
0:06:41 - 0:06:58:  So there's like us, like five or six levels. There's a couple more levels even. And we can train people to any of them. And we don't want to, you know, inundate people and scare them. But I feel like those things are what then turn people into like amazing powerhouses of doing good in this situation and similar situations.
0:07:01 - 0:06:58: 
0:07:10 - 0:07:17:  okay yeah i think for an average person that's like a hard thing to kind of see the connection i need to think of how i can express that in a different way to them um
0:07:17 - 0:07:25:  okay yeah and i and i'll say i think it depends on the thing like martin's got some folks who
0:07:25 - 0:07:27:  where like they're kind of like I'm Martin's
0:07:27 - 0:07:29:  parishioner and Martin's superman like I'm
0:07:29 - 0:07:31:  with him and he's going to do the talking and like you know
0:07:31 - 0:07:33:  and that's like we don't you know
0:07:33 - 0:07:35:  fight with them on that of course we take
0:07:35 - 0:07:37:  people where they're at and we accept it and we
0:07:37 - 0:07:39:  appreciate anything they just want to make sandwiches and not
0:07:39 - 0:07:41:  go out but I feel like when we've
0:07:41 - 0:07:43:  had the opportunity for people to kind of hear it and get
0:07:43 - 0:07:45:  it they kind of can get to another place
0:07:45 - 0:07:47:  and that's probably why some of the tech
0:07:47 - 0:07:49:  I sent you some of these programs like we have this
0:07:49 - 0:07:51:  virtual companion thing where if
0:07:51 - 0:07:53:  Judy and her crew go out six months from
0:07:53 - 0:07:55:  now on their own they can have our virtual
0:07:55 - 0:07:59:  companion. It's like Siri for homelessness. So it's like, hey, I'm on Fifth Street and Ninth
0:07:59 - 0:08:03:  Avenue. The guy is looking for a shower. Can you help me? Or this person looks like they're
0:08:03 - 0:08:07:  mentally ill. Shall I approach them? And our guy will be on the phone with them or on teams with
0:08:07 - 0:08:11:  them and walk them through it. So we have a few of these programs, which we can also train on,
0:08:11 - 0:08:16:  or just, you know, they're open source, they're free, but to make them really customized and
0:08:16 - 0:08:21:  usable, there's more to it. Like if Bethany or the Baltimore government said, hey, we really
0:08:21 - 0:08:24:  want to go deeper with this. Can you make, you got a virtual companion, can you make virtual
0:08:24 - 0:08:30:  companion just for us and like we'll learn and we'll you know document our info and over time
0:08:30 - 0:08:35:  you guys will know what our needs are so there are a variety of customizations of our work which now
0:08:35 - 0:08:40:  that we're getting more clients where we're kind of working on those things person group by group
0:08:40 - 0:08:44:  but they were all created to help people get over the humps that we're talking about right now
0:08:44 - 0:08:52:  because those are very common humps so in terms of the virtual companion is that something that
0:08:52 - 0:09:06:  Like, I could download an app on my phone, or is it something I could show on the computer, like a computer screen in Fellowship Hall that says, like, okay, here's how someone makes these connections.
0:09:07 - 0:09:07: 
0:09:16 - 0:09:22:  Yeah. So so the you know, the main frame for the education that's just open source out there is is these these videos which are accessible just like going on to YouTube. You can just like watch them or you can like take this down, take this little course of ours, which has the easiest questions on Earth.
0:09:22 - 0:09:27:  And you watch a video and answer like a totally easy question. After you finish the 30 videos and questions, you get a certificate.
0:09:28 - 0:09:27: 
0:09:34 - 0:09:40:  get. Those are the ways to get the best basic static information to get more education, to get stuff like virtual companion. You would contact us and then in essence, we do it for you. So if
0:09:40 - 0:09:43:  you skip the videos and skipped everything else and you're like, I'm staying here. I don't know
0:09:43 - 0:09:47:  if this guy's hungry or what to do. Our person would, they got the videos in front of them and
0:09:47 - 0:09:53:  all of our talking points and they can say, hey, I would do this, Sandy or Judy. So they can download
0:09:53 - 0:09:59:  the app, they can make, book an appointment with our virtual companion guys, and then, you know, I
0:09:59 - 0:10:05:  can show you the tech as we're talking, but it's designed to sort of be very easy, so they don't
0:10:05 - 0:10:14:  have to do a lot of downloading to get the info. Okay, but in the meantime, I can take the links
0:10:14 - 0:10:20:  that you gave me and try to show some of this maybe as a video in Fellowship Hall or something.
0:10:21 - 0:10:21: 
0:10:30 - 0:10:32:  Sure. I mean, I can, you know, if you want, I can quickly walk you through what I had sent, if that's helpful, and then you can sort of choose from it.
0:10:32 - 0:10:32:  Yep.
0:10:32 - 0:10:43:  okay um so i'll just share basically the um just find i'll just share it at basically from where i
0:10:43 - 0:10:49:  had sent you that email because i kind of had all the information in there and then you can tell me
0:10:49 - 0:10:54:  um you know if it makes sense we can sort of reconstitute or resend it so it's easier
0:10:54 - 0:11:01:  it'll obviously include the logo and stuff so that um would um would give you that let me just
0:11:01 - 0:11:06:  And then, you know, there are a couple of decks in there as well.
0:11:06 - 0:11:09:  So whatever is the most useful sort of method.
0:11:10 - 0:11:12:  These are the logos right there.
0:11:13 - 0:11:15:  And we put Streetcare also.
0:11:15 - 0:11:16:  Streetcare hopefully will be a company in a few days.
0:11:17 - 0:11:17:  It took New York a while.
0:11:17 - 0:11:22:  They made a mistake with receiving our application, but they should be doing that.
0:11:22 - 0:11:29:  We also mentioned, I don't know if this matters for these guys, but we now have the official approval to do formal local fundraising in Maryland.
0:11:29 - 0:11:30:  We applied and were accepted for that.
0:11:32 - 0:11:39:  so um here is this document um which also included feelings you and i had discussed
0:11:39 - 0:11:43:  which is why i just thought i'd put it in there and then you'd have um access to let
0:11:43 - 0:11:47:  me just pull this out so you can get this whole thing one second i can pull it out so it's full
0:11:47 - 0:11:59:  screen all right so hopefully this will come up for you right now
0:12:01 - 0:12:11:  okay um right so this is just some of this stuff i'll skip this for now unless you want to talk
0:12:11 - 0:12:13:  about some of the stuff we've been doing in baltimore if they ask obviously you can tell
0:12:13 - 0:12:19:  them we've been like reaching out to you know basically every local high school college
0:12:19 - 0:12:25:  baltimore as well as dc um so on street care this was the this is the general street care deck
0:12:25 - 0:12:27:  that we always
0:12:27 - 0:12:29:  use. There are two
0:12:29 - 0:12:31:  versions of this. I actually have to stare at my whole
0:12:31 - 0:12:33:  computer because I don't think it's going to show
0:12:33 - 0:12:34:  you everything.
0:12:36 - 0:12:36:  Oh, actually, it came up.
0:12:36 - 0:12:37:  All right.
0:12:39 - 0:12:42:  When you download it, it's a little cleaner, obviously,
0:12:43 - 0:12:44:  but we can redraft it.
0:12:44 - 0:12:46:  This is, quote, the more liberal version that talks about
0:12:46 - 0:12:49:  vaccination. We can make a version without that.
0:12:49 - 0:12:50:  It has
0:12:50 - 0:12:52:  a walk through Upright Mind,
0:12:53 - 0:12:55:  Street Care, it mentions the vaccination stuff.
0:12:55 - 0:13:04:  um it it walks through sort of bigger picture of of how and why um it has some of the audiences
0:13:04 - 0:13:08:  and sort of where values added you know someone's an elderly person doesn't want to go you know
0:13:08 - 0:13:14:  during the to a soup kitchen etc you know people who don't feel comfortable etc um it walks through
0:13:14 - 0:13:19:  some audiences there's just some very simple blurbs that kind of show some of our stuff
0:13:20 - 0:13:26:  um and the appendices also walk into a little bit some of some of their programs that we offer
0:13:26 - 0:13:31:  this against to serve this includes that baltimore article we had um could be helpful um and this is
0:13:31 - 0:13:40:  actually also this is dc area street care article as well um activities um we have a new app video
0:13:40 - 0:13:44:  we just made because the app is advanced so much i can send you that um but you know of course
0:13:44 - 0:13:48:  there's downloads and it's in this materials they can just download the app and all that's pretty
0:13:48 - 0:13:54:  self-explanatory these are the main programs we now are um pushing so virtual companion which i'll
0:13:54 - 0:13:58:  show you on the website where they can access that um it's very easy so that's why i've walked
0:13:58 - 0:14:03:  through peer support just so you're aware that's something we do so often people are like hey this
0:14:03 - 0:14:07:  stressed me out a little bit or like everyone i talked to is like well you saw homeless person
0:14:07 - 0:14:10:  didn't you like cross the street and get away and like you know so people who can talk to you from
0:14:10 - 0:14:15:  a place of support and you know share your values on it they can set up an appointment with our guys
0:14:15 - 0:14:19:  at any time for that. Or homeless people, of course, can use these things as well. I mentioned
0:14:19 - 0:14:26:  the Homeless Ally course as well. This is more sort of explaining the context of stuff and some
0:14:26 - 0:14:31:  supporters. So I'll show you also, and just stop me anytime. I know it's a lot of information.
0:14:32 - 0:14:40:  In terms of sort of giving people a quick sense of some of these tools, they're, you know, on here,
0:14:40 - 0:14:47:  you can see the app can be downloaded here, iOS, Android, or just a browser-based web app,
0:14:47 - 0:14:50:  so they don't have to download it. They can set up an account for many of those if they want to
0:14:50 - 0:14:57:  set it up. It's pretty self-explanatory. Of course, we can do a walkthrough to the top level of these
0:14:57 - 0:15:03:  programs, which then can be found in more detail here. The ones I had mentioned, they're all here
0:15:03 - 0:15:08:  also. There's some other resources we have also, like some printables, like a few wellness tips,
0:15:08 - 0:15:15:  et cetera. And these are the videos just on their own, all of which is accessible here as well.
0:15:15 - 0:15:18:  So the virtual companion, if they wanted, you know, it shows how you can make an appointment.
0:15:19 - 0:15:22:  You can just call us and people can just kind of take a shot at it. If we're there, we'll get on.
0:15:22 - 0:15:30:  But if they make an appointment, of course, we're happy to, you know, get get into, you know, ongoing or one time discussion with them.
0:15:30 - 0:15:39:  so that's that's that's those things um i'll go backward now to the document i sent you
0:15:39 - 0:15:44:  um and of course anything can be customized you know we've customized these decks and things all
0:15:44 - 0:15:48:  the time so we're happy to do that we can do one for bethany for judy or i know there's tim
0:15:48 - 0:15:54:  martin's gonna be speaking with um this is just a one pager of some things that i think you would
0:15:54 - 0:15:58:  i talked about now that you had said were of interest to you might not be as relevant for
0:15:58 - 0:16:04:  this audience. If it were, we can make it more fancy. Oh, this kind of talks about what we just
0:16:04 - 0:16:08:  talked about. The one I didn't mention is there's also, people are welcome to join, become a chapter
0:16:08 - 0:16:13:  member, which is very simple. We don't charge for our chapters. We welcome donations, but we don't,
0:16:14 - 0:16:21:  you know, make it by fee. And the videos, the one other thing I didn't mention, we can, people can
0:16:21 - 0:16:26:  watch an orientation. I've done them. It's kind of what I'm talking about now, but in more like
0:16:26 - 0:16:31:  granular context if you were out there doing stuff. So this is probably one I did. It might
0:16:31 - 0:16:36:  be Martin, but I think it's me. So that's in this as well. We can obviously do a training for folks
0:16:36 - 0:16:42:  there if they wanted online or in person. And then this is more of a corporate kind of thing.
0:16:43 - 0:16:47:  This is our general, the deck we use now, which I'll show you. And both these have speaker notes
0:16:47 - 0:16:53:  versions. So there's like a PDF version as well as just an inline slides version. I don't know
0:16:53 - 0:16:56:  if that's relevant for these guys. Of course, you're welcome to share it with them. But
0:16:56 - 0:17:01:  this is what we're now we're now sending to like thousands of corporations so it's got speaker
0:17:01 - 0:17:07:  notes it's a very high level walkthrough of a few of the things that we have done and some of our
0:17:07 - 0:17:15:  numbers etc um and a few things for like more corporate stuff so that's basically that and
0:17:15 - 0:17:20:  really fast mr zane allison here that i had sent to you i won't show you both versions of these
0:17:20 - 0:17:25:  because it's like there's speaker notes or not speaker notes we're also creating a two-page
0:17:25 - 0:17:28:  version of that. That's more just a walkthrough without the whole
0:17:28 - 0:17:32:  deck and all that, which I'll send you as kind of talking points. This is the metrics
0:17:32 - 0:17:37:  document you got last month from us. So I won't open that
0:17:37 - 0:17:40:  again. It's just a lot of numbers. And
0:17:40 - 0:17:44:  we had talked at university stuff, you and I, so that's a little bit of that here. So
0:17:44 - 0:17:48:  among that material, hopefully that gives you
0:17:48 - 0:17:53:  more than enough info. From that, if there's certain stuff
0:17:53 - 0:17:57:  that you would like us to resend to you, hey, this is a missed, you know,
0:17:57 - 0:18:00:  package that way or however, we're happy to do that.
0:18:01 - 0:18:02:  Okay.
0:18:03 - 0:18:04:  Yep.
0:18:04 - 0:18:06:  I think we're all good.
0:18:07 - 0:18:07:  Great.
0:18:09 - 0:18:09:  Okay.
0:18:09 - 0:18:12:  So I know Martin was going to take, you know,
0:18:13 - 0:18:16:  we had done a number of reaches to Judy and then we hadn't heard back.
0:18:16 - 0:18:18:  So Martin's going to try her again.
0:18:18 - 0:18:19:  Martin's also trying Tim.
0:18:21 - 0:18:19: 
0:18:26 - 0:18:30:  and apart from that, if there are other things, you know, I know you said, you know, you'll be sending us some stuff at Flyer and all, if there's anything else that comes to mind for you, or even
0:18:30 - 0:18:34:  just, hey, we'd love to build you a blank, but like, there's a real pain, like, you know, we've
0:18:34 - 0:18:37:  got a big tech support team there, we can solve all these problems for us, so, you know, feel
0:18:37 - 0:18:43:  more than free to reach out about anything, if we can help, we're happy to, or if anything else arises.
0:18:46 - 0:18:43: 
0:18:53 - 0:18:58:  yeah i think you know generally speaking like you you create a grand vision but i think people just really want like a granular kind of thing so i'm going to try to see if i can like take all this
0:18:58 - 0:19:06:  material and kind of like bring it down to a practical level for most people yeah you know
0:19:06 - 0:19:11:  and i guess we're and this is you know like apart from all this sort of like company side to me and
0:19:11 - 0:19:16:  And, like, you know, Martin and Terrence and all that, and, you know, I'm sure you as well, it's like we've led these things a lot.
0:19:16 - 0:19:23:  And a lot of times, like, some great group of great people, half of whom have, like, PhDs that are in a place like, you know, the suburban, you know, Baltimore.
0:19:23 - 0:19:29:  And, like, but then they're told to go out and, like, stand on this side of the table and here's the ladle and put the soup in the bowl.
0:19:30 - 0:19:33:  And they don't get to talk to anyone and they might just give out some blankets and they leave.
0:19:34 - 0:19:37:  And, like, they often say, that was kind of not that empowering for me.
0:19:37 - 0:19:39:  I felt I really wanted to talk to that one with the kids.
0:19:39 - 0:19:39: 
0:19:43 - 0:19:47:  I didn't get to because they were gone from the line and like I didn't really interact I didn't feel like I did a lot I'm not sure a lot happened and frankly a lot probably didn't really happen
0:19:47 - 0:19:52:  being very honest when this is done right and we're still working on getting it so to your point
0:19:52 - 0:19:57:  like the people on the granular side get it and use it it really is making a difference and that's
0:19:57 - 0:20:01:  why we made it so you know I know not everyone's going to be ready to like use the app and do a
0:20:01 - 0:20:06:  10-minute discussion with someone be like a sort of quasi social worker but those who are or willing
0:20:06 - 0:20:12:  take any part of that will have a hundred times the level of transformative um you know value
0:20:12 - 0:20:17:  than someone who just hands out the sandwich so you know i always welcome feedback of like
0:20:17 - 0:20:23:  what in mind how we can get to see that get that and do that but i'm totally confident we've seen
0:20:23 - 0:20:29:  it succeed um so you know whatever you need to get it in the language they need to hear
0:20:29 - 0:20:33:  definitely tell us um because i'm always like when these guys have some fancy thing of like
0:20:33 - 0:20:37:  we can do an app thing that's really complicated i'm like a lot of our users are like they're
0:20:37 - 0:20:42:  retired they barely you know even use their phone a lot like keep it simple guys so please um let
0:20:42 - 0:20:47:  us know and we'll we'll try to get to you for this situation just in general okay
0:20:47 - 0:20:58:  all right well let me hop back into my routine here and uh i will be back in touch with you
0:20:58 - 0:21:02:  after I get a chance to kind of, like, assimilate everything over the weekend.
0:21:03 - 0:21:06:  Absolutely, yeah, and feel more than free to reach out and just, like, you know,
0:21:06 - 0:21:07:  I can't understand this.
0:21:07 - 0:21:08:  I'm like, don't worry.
0:21:08 - 0:21:10:  You can just, like, one-off hit us up with anything.
0:21:10 - 0:21:13:  If you CC these guys, it's always great because I often have a hundred things
0:21:13 - 0:21:15:  and they'll catch it and move the ball.
0:21:16 - 0:21:21:  I'll probably email you again with a couple more of them in the CC just so if you hit it up,
0:21:21 - 0:21:22:  we'll get to you fast, okay?
0:21:24 - 0:21:25:  All right, that sounds good.
