üìå MEETING SUMMARY:
The event is set to take place this weekend. There will be a silent auction, a raffle and music. Bethany is happy to assist with social media and other aspects of the event. He also wants to recruit some volunteers.
Bright Mind is a non-profit that helps homeless people through volunteer work. The organization uses gift cards and connections with local stores to cut costs. But it also uses trainings to help people get out into the community.
Volunteers learn how to interact with homeless people and get them to get the help they need. They also learn how they can use the app to get more help. "We don't want to, you know, inundate people and scare them," says one volunteer.
The program is designed to help people get over the humps that we're talking about right now. The main frame for the education that's just open source out there is is these these videos which are accessible just like going on to YouTube.
The group has been reaching out to high school college students in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. The group has applied to do formal local fundraising in Maryland and was accepted for that. They also have a new app video that shows some of their activities.
The program is available on iOS, Android, or just a browser-based web app. People can set up an account for many of those if they want to. There's some other resources we have also, like some printables, like a few wellness tips.
CNN's John Defterios has been working on a series of videos on how to create a more granular version of the software. He says the company is now sending the videos to thousands of corporations. Defterio: "We're happy to help, or if anything else arises"
The app is designed to help people get to know each other. It was created by Martin and Terrence, who have PhDs in social work. The app is free and available on the App Store and Google Play.
Sandra: "We'll get to you fast, okay?" Sandra: "Thanks so much, Sandra. I really appreciate it" "I'll hit it up," Sandra says, "and see you soon"
